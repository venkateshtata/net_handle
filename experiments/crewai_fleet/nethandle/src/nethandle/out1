[95m## Thought:[00m [92mThought: I need to gather the user's current health metrics and analyze them to identify trends and potential risks. I will use the Search a DOCX's content tool to access the user's past medical records and health data.[00m

Moving on then. I MUST either use a tool (use one at time) OR give my best final answer not both at the same time. To Use the following format:

[91m Error parsing LLM output, agent will retry: I did it wrong. Invalid Format: I missed the 'Action:' after 'Thought:'. I will do right next, and don't use a tool I have already used.

If you don't need to use any more tools, you must give your best complete final answer, make sure it satisfy the expect criteria, use the EXACT format below:

Thought: I now can give a great answer
Final Answer: my best complete final answer to the task.
