**Emergency Indicators:**

* Hypoglycemia episodes have been reported 2 instances in the last 3 months, which is a concern and warrants increased monitoring and adjustments to medication or diet.
* High-risk scenarios such as skipping meals or missing medication doses have been observed, which can have serious consequences.

**Wearable Data Analysis:**

* Blood Glucose Monitoring (CGM) reveals elevated daily averages, with fasting glucose levels ranging from 165-170 mg/dL and post-meal peaks often dropping to 70-80 mg/dL after 3 hours.
* Heart rate during activity is lower than expected, which may indicate decreased cardiovascular fitness.
* Sleep patterns are poor, with average sleep duration of 6.5 hours and frequent waking due to nocturia.

**Recommendations:**

* Consult with a healthcare provider to adjust medication or diet to better manage blood sugar control.
* Increase physical activity to improve cardiovascular fitness and overall health.
